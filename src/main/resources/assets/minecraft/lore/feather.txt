This light gray feather was found from the corpse of a commonly found animal called a chicken. Chicken's are found in various places of Earth, with many varients not found. The feathers of this chicken have the potential to be sharp. When near flint, it will react 'shaving' off the outer layer, making it much sharper with the potential to harm. These feathers can also be used to create pillows for a bed, although regular cloth will be cut by the feathers.
